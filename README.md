# Christmas banana synth - Christmas card for 2022

The Christmas banana synth is a stylophone synthesizer with 24 keys and a buzzer for sound. The back features PCB art of a winter landscape. There are also 12 built-in songs available. We used assembly of components by JLCPCB to speed up the process, since we made around 25 boards.
